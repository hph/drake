drake
=====
With drake you can easily generate strong and unique passwords for every
website. The passwords are not stored anywhere and can be algorithmically
generated on any computer. All you need to remember is a single master
password, which you will use for every website; and something that identifies
the account, such as the website itself or an email address. Execute `drake` to
generate a password or `drake -h` for a full list of options.
